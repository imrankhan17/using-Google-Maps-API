# using-Google-Maps-API
Simple function that returns straight line distance between two locations along with estimated journey time from Google Maps.

Later, use a small portion of NYC taxicab data to calculate the distance between two locations acording to Google and comparing that to the data that was recorded.

Data available here: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
